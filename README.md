# Introduction - Guess The Number Game
Created By: KingSurge

Hello Guys, withing the past 30 minutes I started to work on a Guess The Number program.

It is not perfect as yet but i will do my best to keep working on it.

I plan to work on this as much as possible

In the future I aim to make it into an application that creates random numbers for a user to guess.

With this being worked on. I hope to implement this using the Tkinter Module, with an amazing later.

# A little explanation

```py 

# at the top of main.py

log = print

# this is used to make the print statement a little shorter so i could finish quicker. 
# e.g

log("Hello How Are You")

# if you want me to use the original print statement please let me know on Discord or Email Me
#it would really help
```


I Hope You are Doing Well

Please Enjoy Guess The Number and Look Out For Updates
