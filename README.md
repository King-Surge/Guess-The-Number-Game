# Introduction - Guess The Number Game
Created By: KingSurge

Hello Guys, within the past 30 minutes I started to work on a Guess The Number program.

It is not perfect as yet but i will do my best to keep working on it.

I plan to work on this as much as possible

In the future I aim to make it into an application that creates random numbers for a user to guess.

With this being worked on. I hope to implement this using the Tkinter Module, with an amazing later.

# A Little Explanation

```py 

# at the top of main.py

log = print

# this is used to make the print statement a little shorter so i could finish quicker. 
# e.g

log("Hello How Are You")

# if you want me to use the original print statement please let me know on Discord or Email Me
#it would really help
```

```py

guess = int(input("Try And Get The Correct Number \n Enter A Number: "))


# why did I put input() inside

int()

# I did this so it would be designed to only accept numbers/integers instead of strings

# and to make it easier for the if...else...elif... statements so i wouldnt have to type cast each time.

# if you have any suggestions towards this you can cantact me on Discord or via email

```

```py

guess = ""

# I used this as a place holder to allow the if...else...elif statements to work

```

If there is something else you would like me to explain please contact me via email or on discord. 

I will be sure to respond and provide an answer in this repository also
